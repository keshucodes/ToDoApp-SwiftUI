Project Title: SwiftUI Test Driven Development Todo App with CoreData

Summary:

The SwiftUI TDD Todo App with CoreData is a robust mobile application designed to demonstrate the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the context of iOS app development. This project leverages SwiftUI, Apple's modern and intuitive UI framework, and CoreData, a powerful data storage and management technology.

Motivation:

The primary motivation behind this project is to showcase how TDD can be effectively applied to the development of iOS apps. TDD is a development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing actual code. By following TDD practices, developers can create more reliable, maintainable, and bug-free software.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted.
Data Persistence: CoreData is used for efficient data storage and management.
UI Using SwiftUI: The app's user interface is developed entirely using SwiftUI, making it highly responsive and adaptive to different iOS devices.
Testing: The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests and UI tests to ensure the stability and correctness of the app.
Built With:

SwiftUI: The modern and declarative UI framework provided by Apple for building intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.
CoreData: Apple's powerful and efficient framework for data persistence and management in iOS and macOS apps.
Xcode: The integrated development environment (IDE) for building iOS apps.
Getting Started:

To get started with the project, developers need to have Xcode, Apple's official development tool, installed on their macOS machines. After cloning the project's repository from GitHub, they can run it in the Xcode simulator or on a physical iOS device.

Usage:

The app's intuitive user interface allows users to manage their tasks effortlessly. Users can create new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks they no longer need. The app provides a seamless experience for organizing tasks and keeping track of their completion status.

Testing and Reliability:

One of the project's key highlights is its adherence to Test-Driven Development principles. It includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests and UI tests that validate the functionality of the app. This approach ensures that the app behaves as expected and maintains its reliability even as it evolves.

Contributions:

The project is open to contributions from the developer community. Contributors can open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests to enhance the project's functionality, code quality, or user experience.
